                            <p>Anders left home when he was 20 years old. The following 8 years he worked in 8 different countries as a barista, constantly learning about coffee and the entire industry; so much roasteries even hired him as a representative and to throw barista lessons to staff in the café’s that used their coffee. Jeppe graduated as a mechanical engineer in 2017. Shortly after, he got offered a job in the USA – not as an engineer, but as a barista. After having worked as a barista for 8 years in USA, New Zealand and Europe, Jeppe then worked in a position where he travelled all over the world, teaching how to operate fully automated coffee machines.

                            <p>An idea blossomed. While working in cafés all over the world, the boys realised that most venues would benefit from working with fully automated coffee machines rather than manual ones. So why does hardly anyone use them? Because manufacturers don’t know who they’re talking to. Dream Shot does.</p>
